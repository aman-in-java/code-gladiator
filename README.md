<h1>Earthquake in Africa</h1>
<p>Africa has been hit by an earthquake. There are total N cities in Africa out of which K have been affected by this earthquake. The cities are numbered from 1 to N.</p>

<p>United Nations has decided to establish a relief base in one of these (N - K) non-affected cities. Although the UN has lot of relief packets, but it has a single carrier truck to distribute these packets. The truck starts at the base in the morning and goes to all the K cities one by one. It finally returns to the base again in the evening after distributing relief packets to all the K cities.</p>

<p>Note that the truck may have to visit some non-affected cities also while going from one affected city to some other affected city. There are M bi-directional roads between the cities.</p>
